This project focuses on the comparative analysis of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional clustering algorithms for graph-structured data analysis. GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from graph data, while traditional clustering algorithms provide valuable insights into the structural properties of graphs. The main objectives of this project are to:

1. Evaluate the performance of GNN methods, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), GraphSAGE, and Deep Infomax, on benchmark datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.
2. Compare the effectiveness of traditional clustering algorithms, including K-means, Spectral Clustering, and the Louvain Method, for graph clustering tasks.
3. Analyze the structural properties of graphs using metrics such as density, entropy, modularity, and conductance.
4. Investigate the interaction between GNN methods and clustering algorithms to gain insights into their combined performance for graph analysis tasks.

To achieve these objectives, the project involves preprocessing the datasets, implementing GNN models and clustering algorithms, training and evaluating the models, and analyzing the results. The performance of each method is assessed based on metrics such as accuracy, clustering quality, and structural properties of the resulting clusters. Additionally, visualizations and graphs are generated to provide intuitive representations of the analysis findings.

Overall, this project aims to contribute to the understanding of GNN methods and traditional clustering algorithms in the context of graph analysis, with implications for various real-world applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and biological network analysis.
